# g:
# special object (unique) for each request. To store data that might be accessed by multiple functs during the request.
# The conn is stored and reused instead of creating a new conn if get_db is called a second time in the same request.

# current_app:
# is another special object that points to the Flask application handling the request.
# Since you used an application factory, there is no application object when writing the rest of your code.
# get_db will be called when the application has been created and is handling a request, so current_app can be used.

# open_resource()
# opens a file relative to the flaskr package, which is useful since you wonâ€™t necessarily know where that location is
# when deploying the application later.
# get_db returns a database connection, which is used to execute the commands read from the file.

#
# Register with the Application:

# app.teardown_appcontext()
# tells Flask to call that function when cleaning up after returning the response.

# app.cli.add_command()
# adds a new command that can be called with the flask command.

# Run the init-db command:
# $ flask init-db
